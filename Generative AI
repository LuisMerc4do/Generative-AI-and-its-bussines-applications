What is Generative AI?

Generative AI (GenAI) is a type of Artificial Intelligence capable of creating a wide range of data, such as images, videos, audio, text, and 3D models. GenAI learns patterns from existing data and then uses this knowledge to generate new and unique outputs. GenAI can produce highly realistic and complex content mimicking humans, thus making it a valuable tool for many industries like gaming, entertainment, and product design. Recent advancements in this field, like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) and Midjourney, have opened up new possibilities in using GenAI to solve complex problems, create art, or assist in scientific research.

Generative AI can learn from various sources and generate new content that reflects the characteristics of the training data but does not repeat it.
